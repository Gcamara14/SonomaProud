## Directory of all the businesses and people that helped out during the fire

Why am I making this?

*   This list to honor all the people/businesses who have donated and helped the evacuees. They weren't forced, but they helped out of the kindness of their hearts
*   This is our way to give back to them. Each posting will have a list to the business social media page so that people can return their kindness with facebook likes/google reviews...Those reviews go a long way in the success of a business!
*   We will have a list of businesses we know have done good for the community and aren't scammers.
